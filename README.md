## **Usage**

### **1. Check Tool Version**
To confirm the tool is installed correctly, check its version:
```bash
python my_tool.py version
```

---

### **2. Create a New Flutter Project**
Generate a new Flutter project with a predefined directory structure:
```bash
python my_tool.py create <project_name>
```
Example:
```bash
python my_tool.py create MyFlutterApp
```

#### **Directory Structure:**
```
MyFlutterApp/
  â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ entities/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config/
```

### **3. Generate an Equatable Entity from CSV**
Create a Dart entity based on the headers and data types in a CSV file:
```bash
python my_tool.py generate_entity <csv_path> <entity_name>
```
Example:
```bash
python my_tool.py generate_entity ./entities.csv User
```
- **CSV Example:**
  ```csv
  id,name,age,isActive
  1,John,25,true
  2,Jane,30,false
  ```

#### **Output:**
A Dart file will be created in `lib/core/entities/<entity_name>.dart`.

---

### **4. Generate a Responsive Flutter Layout**
Add a predefined responsive layout template to your Flutter project:
```bash
python my_tool.py flutter_layout <project_name>
```
Example:
```bash
python my_tool.py flutter_layout MyFlutterApp
```

#### **Output:**
The file `responsive_layout.dart` will be created in the `lib/` directory.

---

### **5. Change Flutter Project Package Name**
Update the package name for both Android and iOS in your Flutter project:
```bash
python my_tool.py change_package_name <new_package_name>
```
Example:
```bash
python my_tool.py change_package_name com.example.mynewapp
```

---

### **6. Initialize NMT Configuration**
Set up the default NMT configuration for a Flutter project:
```bash
python my_tool.py init
```

#### **Output:**
A file `nmt.json` will be created with basic project configuration.
